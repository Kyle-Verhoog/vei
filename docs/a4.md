# Assignment 2: Environment Building

## Environments
Location: [src/main/scala/compiler/joos1w/environment](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/kgsuwala/cs444-w19-vei/tree/a4/src/main/scala/compiler/joos1w/environment)
We broke environment building into 7 different classes of environment:

1) Generic environment: is the parent class for all environments and includes
logic for handling classes, methods and variables. It provides lookup methods
for each of these.
2) Root environment: is a singleton used to represent the global namespace.
This is used for resolving packages.
3) Package environment: is used to represent a package. This stores class
and interface related information.
4) Class environment: is used to represent methods and fields for a given
class. The class environment also does the `contains`, `nodecl`, `inherit`,
`super`, etc classes. Functi
5) Method environment: just holds the method metadata.
6) Variable environment: an environment containing a variable along with
metadata about the variable.
7) Block environment: this represents `{ }`.

### Building Environments
#### First pass
For the first pass through the AST we generate package, class and variable
environments. In this pass we do checks including the following:
- check duplicate class/method declarations
- duplicate variable declarations

#### Second pass (verification pass)
In this pass we check that types exist and all qualified names resolve to a
class or interface. Here the `contains`, `super`, etc. sets are generated and
used. Essentially all checks are done in this pass. We perform, among others,
the following checks:

- import priorities
- verify return types for methods exist
- no cycles exist in hierarchies
- no collisions in imports
- class doesn't extend a final class
